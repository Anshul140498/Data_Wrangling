# Data_Wrangling
- In this project 3 datasets are beinf used to do Data processing.
- All the steps related to Data wrangling is being covered and further data analysis is also done.
  
**1)** **Data Merging**
- Here in Dataset 1 and 2 are merged .
- I have used left join to merge the datasets as both are related to each other.
- Unnecessary columns (ex- atemp) were dropped as they couldn't contribute much furtjher in the analysis.
